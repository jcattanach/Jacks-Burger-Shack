## Jack's Burger Shack

This is my full-stack burger order project. This app uses React and Redux on the client side and Node.js, MongoDb (with MongooseJS), and Express on the server side, along with the Stripe payment API.

The purpose of this application is to allow the user/ customer to customize a burger order, for a fictional restaurant, and pay for the order using the Stripe API.
